# Loto_Checker
## Description
A piece of software that checks if one won the lottery by sending an SMS to a specific phone number using API calls.

This project enables users to be informed if they become millionaires. 

When run periodically, the Lottery Checker saves the users time by letting them know about the lottery results every time new lottery-winning numbers are drawn.

## Features
- A test suite that scrapes the winning lottery numbers from the [EuroJackpot website](https://www.eurojackpot.com/) into a text file, using Robot framework;
- A function that compares the winning numbers, with the numbers the user played, which can be set by the user.
- A function that sends both winning numbers and played numbers to the user's phone number, by calling the [Twillio API](https://www.twilio.com/en-us).
